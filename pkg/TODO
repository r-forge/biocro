 o Keep working on the EvapoTrans function the ga r boundary layer of
   the leaf needs to be improved. There is the version from WIMOVAC,
   the version of Leuning and the version from Thornley.

 o Look at the sunML function (both R and C) there is a bug that only 
   seems to occur at certain combinations of days and hours that
   triggers a high diffuse radiation. The kd needs to be calculated
   rather than a fixed value of say 0.7.

 o Notes about the model: the soil water potential seems to stop at
   -1500 but  this should not be the case. It should be able to go down lower.

 o The function to model corn has limitations. Although it is working
   fairly well there is more work to do regarding the reproductive
   period since only carbon is being allocated but there is no
   consideration for pollen production or silking. 

 o I should at some point get rid of the MCMCBioGro function since it
   is very difficult to maintain now with all the changes happening to
   BioGro
