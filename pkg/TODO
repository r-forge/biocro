Immediate priorities

 o After I fix the water balance problem I will work on the multiple
   layer model

 o Include Hamze's work on simulating root respiration

 o Need to work on soil. Allow the possibility of determining
   different soil properties for different layers.

 o Create a simple model of soil temperature.

 o Possibly get rid of some redundancy such as SoilWatCont and cwsMat
   in BioGro output

 o Include 0.9882 in the conversion of evapotranspiration in mass to volume

Nitrogen

 o Determine the N demand from the crop

Less immediate priorities

 o Add the possibility of computing water stress using a supply and
   demand approach instead of the soil water content approach 

 o There is a known 'bug' that is not that easy to fix. It is related
   to CosZenithAngle which can cause very high photosynthesis late in
   the day with observed data (i.e. data not processed with the weach
   function).

 o The weach function can be improved to reflect better relationships
   for relative humidity and wind speed. There is also an assumption
   that 0.12 of the radiation in a day occurs during an hour at peak
   insolation.

 o In sunML/CanA the kd needs to be calculated rather than a fixed value of say 0.7.

 o Notes about the model: the soil water potential seems to stop at
   -1500 but  this should not be the case. It should be able to go down lower.

 o The function to model corn has limitations. Although it is working
   fairly well there is more work to do regarding the reproductive
   period since only carbon is being allocated but there is no
   consideration for pollen production or silking. 

 o I should at some point get rid of the MCMCBioGro function since it
   is very difficult to maintain now with all the changes happening to
   BioGro
