Immediate priorities

 o Keep working on the testing of EvapoTranspiration. It seems now
   Priestly works well. Penman depends on the bulk conductance so it
   is affected by 'ga' in the model. Penman-Monteith is affected by
   both 'ga' and 'gc' or stomatal conductance. I might want to
   do an experiment where I test all possible combinations of
   calculations of ga using the WIMOVAC method, the Thornley method
   and possible side effects of leaf temperature. 

Less immediate priorities

 o Test the Century model and implement the possibility of running it
   at an hourly and yearly time step

 o Incorporate Century in MaizeGro

 o In the Century model the Min N needs to be looked at. I just
   changed the demand to be dependent on the new Leaf and Stem.

 o There is a known 'bug' that is not that easy to fix. It is related
   to CosZenithAngle which can cause very high photosynthesis late in
   the day with observed data (i.e. data not processed with the weach
   function).

 o The weach function can be improved to reflect better relationships
   for relative humidity and wind speed. There is also an assumption
   that 0.12 of the radiation in a day occurs during an hour at peak
   insolation.

 o In sunML/CanA the kd needs to be calculated rather than a fixed value of say 0.7.

 o Notes about the model: the soil water potential seems to stop at
   -1500 but  this should not be the case. It should be able to go down lower.

 o The function to model corn has limitations. Although it is working
   fairly well there is more work to do regarding the reproductive
   period since only carbon is being allocated but there is no
   consideration for pollen production or silking. 

 o I should at some point get rid of the MCMCBioGro function since it
   is very difficult to maintain now with all the changes happening to
   BioGro
