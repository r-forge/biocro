 o Notes about the model: the soil water potential seems to stop at
   -1500 but  this should not be the case. It should be able to go down lower.

 o The function to model corn has limitations. Although it is working
   fairly well there is more work to do regarding the reproductive
   period since only carbon is being allocated but there is no
   consideration for pollen production or silking. 

 o I should at some point get rid of the MCMCBioGro function since it
   is very difficult to maintain now with all the changes happening to
   BioGro
